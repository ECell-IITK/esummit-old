        <img src="images/workshops/reinforcement.png" width="200" style="padding: 10px 0" />

        <p>In the infield of Marketing, one of the core challenges is that the business condition changes all the time.
            A winning campaign strategy can become unfavored over time, while an old strategy can gain new traction. So
            far in digital marketing and web analytics, A/B testing is the prevalent method of comparing digital
            campaigns, choosing the winning ad, and deciding targeting strategy. A/B testing is excellent when testing
            variations on similar solutions and having one or more metrics that are clear indicators of success or
            failure. However, when faced with a complex problem or working on future topics, A/B testing fails to
            deliver. Achieving long-term impact from experimentation is demanding and resource-intensive. As firms
            aspire and compete to be fully digital with a limited marketing budget and deadlines to realize the tangible
            $ impact, shifting from conventional test and target strategy to the next-gen approach is imperative. This
            session proposes state-of-the-art techniques and presents their applications in Digital marketing campaigns.
